# WEATHER-REPORTING
IoT based Weather Reporting System
This is a simple Smart Weather Reporting system using Raspberry Pi 4B+ and weather-related sensors. The system monitors and reports the weather parameters such as: Temperature,Humidity,Pressure, and gives alerts whenever it rains. We have also used ThingSpeak Cloud platform for data collection and performed advanced data analysis using MATLAB and the IFTTT service to send alerts and notification.
